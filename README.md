Used plugins in this dashboard:

- [React 16.8.x](https://reactjs.org) - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- [react-router 5.x.x](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router) - Declarative routing for React
- [react-bootstrap 1.0.0-beta.10](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/) - React bootstrap replaces the Bootstrap javascript
- [styled-components 4.x.x](https://www.styled-components.com/) - styled-components is the result of wondering how we could enhance CSS for styling React component systems.
